// basically  builder pattern reduce the complexity of creating complex object
// some cases we have to use multiple constructer for create a instance of a class

// problem statement

// “Happy Shopping Store” is an online shopping system.
//  There when a registered customer buys an item from the store it
//  needs to provide five attributes as first name, last name, age, phone, and address 
//  as the delivery details in order to deliver the item to the particular customer. 
//  And here we want only the first name and the last name of the registered customer and the rest 
//  other fields are optional. Because system already have the delivery details of all 
//  the registered customers. So let’s solve this real world problem







class ShoppingUser {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello world");
    }
